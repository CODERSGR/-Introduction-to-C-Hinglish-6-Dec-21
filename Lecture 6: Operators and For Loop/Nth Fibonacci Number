Nth Fibonacci Number
Send Feedback
Nth term of Fibonacci series F(n), where F(n) is a function, is calculated using the following formula -
    F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), 
    Where, F(1) = F(2) = 1
Provided N you have to find out the Nth Fibonacci Number.
Input Format :
The first line of each test case contains a real number ‘N’.
Output Format :
For each test case, return its equivalent Fibonacci number.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10000     
Where ‘N’ represents the number for which we have to find its equivalent Fibonacci number.

Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1:
6
Sample Output 1:
8
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
Now the number is ‘6’ so we have to find the “6th” Fibonacci number
So by using the property of the Fibonacci series i.e 

[ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
So the “6th” element is “8” hence we get the output.

Nth Fibonacci Number
Problem Description: You are given an input integer N, and you have to calculate the Nth
Fibonacci number.
For example, if the given number is 7, then the Fibonacci series will be 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,........ Then
13 will be the 7th fibonacci number.
How to approach?
The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the sequence such that the current number will be the
sum of the previous two numbers i.e. F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
And given that F(1)=F(2)=1
1. Take the number as input from the user.
2. Initialize 1st and second number with 1.
3. Now, start moving iteratively till the Nth number is calculated. To calculate the current
number, equate it as sum of the previous two numbers. And continue to move further.
Pseudo Code for this problem:
Input = N
a=1
b=1
For i=1 till i less than N:
 c=a+b
 a=b
 b=c
print(a)
❏ Let us dry run the code:
N=7
● a=1
b=1
● i=1
c=a+b=2
a=b=1
b=c=2
● i=2
c=a+b=3
a=b=2
b=c=3
● i=3
c=a+b=5
a=b=3
b=c=5
● i=4
c=a+b=8
a=b=5
b=c=8
● i=5
c=a+b=13
a=b=8
b=c=13
● i=6
c=a+b=21
a=b=13
b=c=21
● i=7, move out of the loop, so print a i.e. 13.
● So final output: 13
