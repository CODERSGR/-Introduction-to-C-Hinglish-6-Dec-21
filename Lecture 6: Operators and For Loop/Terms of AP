Terms of AP
Problem Description: You are given a number x and you have to print the first x numbers of the
AP series 3N+2 which are not multiples of 4 .
How to approach?
1. Take the number x as input from the user.
2. Initialize the count of numbers from 1 and N from 1.
3. Run a loop while count is less than or equal to x.
4. Calculate the number to printed as 3*N+2
5. If number is not divisible by 4 print it and increment the count.
Pseudo Code for this problem:
Input=N
count=1, N=1
While count is less than or equal to x:
 num=3*N+2
 If num is not divisible by 4:
 print(num)
 Increment the count by 1
 Increment N by 1
❏ Let us dry run the code:
 x=4
● count=1, N=1
num=3*1+2=5
5 is not divisible by 4, so print 5 and increment count.
● count=2, N=2
num=3*2+2=8
8 is divisible by 4, so don’t print it.
● count=2, N=3
num=3*3+2=11
11 is not divisible by 4, so print 11 and increment count.
● count=3, N=4
num=3*4+2=14
14 is not divisible by 4, so print 14 and increment count.
● count=4, N=5
num=3*5+2=17
17 is not divisible by 4, so print 5 and increment count.
● count=5, move out of the loop and end.
● So final output:
5 11 14 17
