Reverse of a number
Send Feedback
Write a program to generate the reverse of a given number N. Print the corresponding reverse number.
Note : If a number has trailing zeros, then its reverse will not include them. For e.g., reverse of 10400 will be 401 instead of 00401.


Input format :
Integer N
Output format :
Corresponding reverse number
Constraints:
0 <= N < 10^8
Sample Input 1 :
1234
Sample Output 1 :
4321
Sample Input 2 :
1980
Sample Output 2 :
891

Reverse of a number
Problem Description: You are given a number N, then you have to print the reverse of this
number N.
For example, if the given number N is 1234, then you have to print 4321.
How to approach?
1. Take the number N as input from the user.
2. Initialize the reverse number from 0, and a variable temp equal to N.
3. Run a while loop until temp becomes 0 and in each iteration pick up the last digit of the
number by taking modulo 10 and make it as the first digit of reverse number by
multiplying the already existing reverse number by 10 and then adding the last digit
obtained to it and pass temp as temp/10 to the next iteration.
4. Print the reverse number.
Pseudo Code for this problem:
Input=N
temp=N, rev_num=0
While temp is greater than 0:
 Last_digit=temp modulo 10
 temp=temp/10
 rev_num=rev_num*10+last_digit
print(rev_num)
❏ Let us dry run the code:
 x=1234
● temp=1234, rev_num=0
last_digit=4
temp=123
rev_num=0*10+4=4
● temp=123, rev_num=4
last_digit=3
temp=12
rev_num=4*10+3=43
● temp=12, rev_num=43
last_digit=2
temp=1
rev_num=43*10+2=432
● temp=1, rev_num=432
last_digit=1
temp=0
rev_num=432*10+1=4321
● So final output:
4321
