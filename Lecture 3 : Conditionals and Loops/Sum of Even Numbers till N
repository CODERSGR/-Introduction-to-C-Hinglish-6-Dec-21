/*************************************************** SOLUTION *************************************************************************/





/*
	Pre-requisite to solve this problem:
	In this question, we have to find sum of all even numbers till n. To take sum of all the even numbers, we have to take a variable and initialize it to zero. Let us name this variable as sum. 
	Following code is used to add 2 to sum variable and update it to the same sum variable:
	sum = sum + 2 
	
	Hint to solve this problem: We will have to loop on even numbers only and add the even numbers to the same sum variable, described above.

Sum of Even Numbers till N
Problem Description: In this question, you are given with a number N, you have to print the
sum of all even number till N.
How to approach?
1. Take the number N as input from the user.
2. Initialize i from 0 and initial sum with 0 and run a loop upto n to sum the values of i by
giving an increment of 2 at each step, so that only the even numbers are added.
Pseudo Code for the given problem:
n=input
i=0
sum=0
While i less than or equal to n:
 sum=sum+i
 i=i+2
print(sum)
❏ Let us dry run the given code for n=7
● i=0, i<=7 so sum=0+0=0.
● i=0+2=2(<=7), so sum=0+2=2
● i=2+2=4(<=7), so sum=2+4=6
● i=4+2=6(<=7) so sum=6+6=12.
● i=6+2=8(>7) so print sum=12 as output
