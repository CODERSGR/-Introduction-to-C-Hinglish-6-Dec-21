Write a program that takes a character as input and prints either 1, 0 or -1 according to the following rules.
1, if the character is an uppercase alphabet (A - Z)
0, if the character is a lowercase alphabet (a - z)
-1, if the character is not an alphabet
Input format :
Single Character
Output format :
1 or 0 or -1
Constraints :
Input can be any character
Sample Input 1 :
v
Sample Output 1 :
0
Sample Input 2 :
V
Sample Output 2 :
1
Sample Input 3 :
#
Sample Output 3 :
-1

Find Character Case
Problem Description: In the given problem, you have to print 1 if the input character is
uppercase, 0 if it is lowercase, or -1 if it is an invalid character.
For example: if input character is ‘A’ output should be 1
if input character is ‘a’ output should be 0
if input character is ‘*’ output should be -1
How to approach?
1. Take the input character form the user.
2. Check for the conditions if the given character lies between “A” and “Z”, this means we
have uppercase in the input character then print 1, if it lies between “a” and “z”, we have
lowercase in the input character then print 0 otherwise print -1.
Pseudo code for the problem:
Take the input from the user.
input=ch
If ch>=‘A’ and ch<=‘Z’:
 print(1)
If ch>= ‘a’ and ch<=‘z’:
 print(0)
Else:
 print(-1)
❏ Let us dry run the code:
● If the input is Y, it satisfies the 1st condition: ch>= ‘A’ and ch<= ‘Z’,
therefore, 1 will be printed.
● If the input is y, it satisfies the 2nd condition: ch>=’a’ and ch<=’z’,
therefore, 0 will be printed.
● If the input is #, we will move to the else and -1 will be printed
