Sort 0 1 2
Send Feedback
You are given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N. It contains only 0s, 1s and 2s. Write a solution to sort this array/list in a 'single scan'.
'Single Scan' refers to iterating over the array/list just once or to put it in other words, you will be visiting each element in the array/list just once.
Note:
You need to change in the given array/list itself. Hence, no need to return or print anything. 
Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

First line of each test case or query contains an integer 'N' representing the size of the array/list.

Second line contains 'N' single space separated integers(all 0s, 1s and 2s) representing the elements in the array/list.
Output Format :
For each test case, print the sorted array/list elements in a row separated by a single space.

Output for every test case will be printed in a separate line.
Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= N <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
1
7
0 1 2 0 2 0 1
Sample Output 1:
0 0 0 1 1 2 2 
Sample Input 2:
2
5
2 2 0 1 1
7
0 1 2 0 1 2 0
Sample Output 2:
0 1 1 2 2 
0 0 0 1 1 2 2

Sort 0 1 2 
Problem Description:​ ​You are given an integer array containing only 0s, 1s and 2s.
Write a solution to sort this array using one scan only.
Sample Input:
 ​7
0 1 2 0 2 0 1
Sample Output:
 ​0 0 0 1 1 2 2
How to approach?
Trivia time! In case you didn’t know, this problem is a variation of a famous problem
called the ‘Dutch National Flag Problem’
Let’s discuss what we need to do in this problem. Basically, we need to push all 0s in
the array towards the front of the array and push all the 2s towards the end of the array.
Notice that if we do this, the 1s will automatically come in between the 0s and 2s.
We’ll use a three pointer approach to solve this problem; the three pointers will be:
current, ​zeroPos and ​twoPos. Let’s discuss what will be the purpose of these three
pointers:
1. current - This will hold the position of the current element that we’re on during
the iteration of the array. This will be initialised to 0.
2. zeroPos - This will hold the index where we will push any 0s that we may
encounter. This will be initialised to 0.
3. twoPos - This will hold the index where we will push any 2s that we may
encounter. This will be initialised to ​n - 1, where ​n is the size of the array
Let’s discuss the approach to this problem in some detail. We’ll iterate through the array
using the ​current pointer. Every element is either 0, 1 or 2 so let’s see what we’ll be
doing in each of these cases.
1. arr[current] = 0 - In this case, we need to push the element towards the
front of the array. To do that we can swap ​arr[current] and ​arr[zeroPos],
then we will increase both ​current and ​zeroPos by 1.
2. arr[current] = 1 - In this case, we will just increase ​current by 1, since
we are only concerned with push 0s to the front and 2s to the end of the array.
3. arr[current] = 2 - In this case, we need to push the element towards the
end of the array. Again, to do this, we’ll just swap ​arr[current] and
arr[twoPos]. We will decrease ​twoPos by 1. However, in this case we will ​not
increase ​current by 1 (we’ll discuss why later).
Now let’s discuss why we didn’t increase ​current by 1 in the case where
arr[current] = 2. But before that there’s one more thing that we need to discuss.
What will be the condition that must be satisfied so that our loop can end? You might
think that it’s when current reaches the end of the array but that’s not the case here.
Let’s see why.
Can you see what exactly the two pointers, ​zeroPos and ​twoPos are doing? As we go
through the array, every element before ​zeroPos is a 0 and every element after ​twoPos
is a 2. Also, every element after ​zeroPos but before current is a 1. Therefore, all these
elements are ‘sorted’. The element that remain to be sorted are the ones that lie
between the indices ​current and ​twoPos. Therefore our loop will terminate when
current reaches the value of ​twoPos.
Now, let’s understand why we can’t increase the value of current when ​arr[current]
= 2. When we swap ​arr[current] with ​arr[twoPos], we don’t know what value
was initially at index ​twoPos (before the swap happened), it could be any of the values
0, 1, or 2. So, we can’t increase the value of current without checking what value was
swapped with ​twoPos. We didn’t have to worry about this in the case where we were
swapping ​arr[current] with ​arr[zeroPos] because then we would always be
swapping 0 and 1. The pseudo code at the next page will make this clear.
The pseudo-code for this approach is shown on the next page
function sort012(arr):
current <- 0
zeroPos <- 0
twoPos <- arr.size - 1
while(current < twoPos):
if(arr[current] == 0):
swap(arr[current], arr[zeroPos]
current <- current + 1
zeroPos <- zeroPos + 1
else if(arr[current] == 1):
current <- current + 1
else:
swap(arr[current], arr[twoPos])
twoPos <- twoPos - 1
