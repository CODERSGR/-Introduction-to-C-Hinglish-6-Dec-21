Character Pattern
Problem Description: You are given with an input number N, then you have to print the given
pattern corresponding to that number N.
For example if N=4
Pattern output:A
 BC
 CDE
 DEFG
How to approach?
1. Take N as input from the user.
2. Figure out the number of rows, (which is N here) and run a loop for that.
3. Now, figure out how many columns are to be printed for ith row (which is equal to row
number i.e i here) and run a loop for that within this.
4. Now, figure out “What to print?” in a particular row, column number. It can depend on
the column number, row number or N which depends on both column number and row
number here. As each row starts from ‘A’+i-1 and increases with 1 for each column.
Pseudo code for the given problem:
input=N
i=1
While i is less than or equal to N:
 Character x=’A’+i-1
 While j is less than or equal to i:
 print(x)
 Increment j by 1
 Increment x by 1
 Increment i by 1
 Add a new line here
❏ Let us dry run the Code for N=4
● i=1(<=4)
➔ j=1 (<=1), so print ‘A’.
➔ j=2(>1), move out of the inner loop with a new line.
● i=2(<=4)
➔ j=1 (<=2), so print ‘B’.
➔ j=2 (<=2), so print ‘C’.
➔ j=3(>2), move out of the inner loop with a new line.
● i=3(<=4)
➔ j=1 (<=3), so print ‘C’
➔ j=2 (<=3), so print ‘D’
➔ j=3 (<=3), so print ‘E’
➔ j=4(>3), move out of the inner loop with a new line.
● i=4(<=4)
➔ j=1 (<=4), so print ‘D’
➔ j=2 (<=4), so print ‘E’
➔ j=3 (<=4), so print ‘F’
➔ j=4 (<=4), so print ‘G’
➔ j=5(>4), move out of the inner loop with a new line.
● i=5(>4), move out of the loop
So , final output:
 A
 BC
 CDE
 DEFG
